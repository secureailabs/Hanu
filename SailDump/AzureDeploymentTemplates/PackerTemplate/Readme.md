## Run image create script
Run the AzureImageCreate.sh script to build VM images which is a two step process.
First it will create a VHD image using packer and then there is a manual process to convert that image to a managed image.
where the user needs to copy the vhd image url and paste it as a user input in the terminal when asked for.

## Requirements
`../../Binary/vm_initializer.py` should exist before running this script which can be created by running `make all` in the `VirtualMachine/VmInitializer` directory.
